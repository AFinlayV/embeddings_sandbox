Numerous indigenous cultures formed, and many saw transformations in the th century away from more densely populated lifestyles and towards reorganized polities elsewhere. The European colonization of the Americas began in the late th century, however most colonies in what would later become the United States were settled after . By the s, the thirteen British colonies contained .million people and were established along the Atlantic Coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of taxes, including the Stamp Act of , rejecting the colonists constitutional argument that new taxes needed their approval. Resistance to these taxes, especially the Boston Tea Party in , led to Parliament issuing punitive laws designed to end selfgovernment. Armed conflict began in Massachusetts in .In , in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States. Led by General George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War. The peace treaty of  established the borders of the new sovereign state. The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A convention wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in  and a Bill of Rights was added in  to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in  doubled the size of the United States.Encouraged by the notion of manifest destiny, the United States expanded to the Pacific Coast. While the nation was large in terms of area, its population in  was only four million. Westward expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners. The expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states north of the MasonDixon line by , but states in the south continued the institution, to support the kinds of large scale agriculture that dominated the southern economy. The division of the country along these lines formed the major political issue of the first eight decades of the growth of the United States. Precipitated by the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in , the Civil War began as the southern states seceded from the Union to form their own proslavery country, the Confederate States of America. The defeat of the Confederates in  led to the abolition of slavery. In the Reconstruction era following the war, legal and voting rights were extended to freed slaves. The national government emerged much stronger, and gained explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white southern Democrats regained their political power in the South in , often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they passed Jim Crow laws to maintain white supremacy, as well as new state constitutions that legalized discrimination based on race and prevented most African Americans from participating in public life.The United States became the worlds leading industrial power at the turn of the th century, due to an outburst of entrepreneurship and industrialization and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers. A national railroad network was completed and largescale mines and factories were established. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency, and traditional politics stimulated the Progressive movement, from the s to the s, leading to reforms, including the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, granting of citizenship to many indigenous people, alcohol prohibition, and womens suffrage. Initially neutral during World War I, the United States declared war on Germany in  and funded the Allied victory the following year. After the prosperous Roaring Twenties, the Wall Street Crash of  marked the onset of the decadelong worldwide Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented his New Deal programs, including relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, social security, and a minimum wage. The New Deal defined modern American liberalism. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered World War II and financed the Allied war effort, and helped defeat Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in the European theater. Its involvement culminated in using newly American invented nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to defeat Imperial Japan in the Pacific War.This article is part of a series on theCulture of the United StatesSocietyHistoryLanguagePeoplerace and ethnicityReligionArts and literatureArchitectureArtDanceFashionLiteraturecomicspoetryMusicSculptureTheaterOtherCuisineFestivalsFolkloreMedianewspapersradiocinemaTVInternetMythologySportsSymbolsFlagGreat SealMonumentsMottoAnthemBirdWorld Heritage SitesUnited States portalvteThe United States and the Soviet Union emerged as rival superpowers in the aftermath of World War II. During the Cold War, the two countries confronted each other indirectly in the arms race, the Space Race, propaganda campaigns, and localized wars against communist expansion. In the s, in large part due to the strength of the civil rights movement, another wave of social reforms was enacted which enforced the constitutional rights of voting and freedom of movement to African Americans. The Cold War ended when the Soviet Union was officially dissolved, leaving the United States as the worlds sole superpower. Foreign policy after the Cold War has often focused on many modern conflicts in the Middle East, especially in response to the September  attacks. Early in the st century, the United States experienced the Great Recession and the COVID pandemic, which had a negative effect on the local economy.PrehistoryeditMain articles Prehistory of the United States, History of Native Americans in the United States, and PreColumbian eraSee also Native Americans in the United States Approximate location of the icefree corridor and specific Paleoindian sites Clovis theoryIt is not definitively known how or when Native Americans first settled the Americas and the presentday United States. The prevailing theory proposes that people from Eurasia followed game across Beringia, a land bridge that connected Siberia to presentday Alaska during the Ice Age, and then spread southward throughout the Americas. This migration may have begun as early as , years ago and continued through to about , years ago, when the land bridge became submerged by the rising sea level caused by the melting glaciers.These early inhabitants, called PaleoIndians, soon diversified into hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.This preColumbian era incorporates all periods in the history of the Americas before the appearance of European influences on the American continents, spanning from the original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the early modern period. While the term technically refers to the era before Christopher Columbus voyage in , in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbuss initial landing.PaleoIndianseditMain article PreColumbian North America The cultural areas of preColumbian North America, according to Alfred KroeberBy , BCE, humans were relatively wellestablished throughout North America. Originally, PaleoIndians hunted Ice Age megafauna like mammoths, but as they began to go extinct, people turned instead to bison as a food source. As time went on, foraging for berries and seeds became an important alternative to hunting. PaleoIndians in central Mexico were the first in the Americas to farm, starting to plant corn, beans, and squash around , BCE. Eventually, the knowledge began to spread northward. By , BCE, corn was being grown in the valleys of Arizona and New Mexico, followed by primitive irrigation systems and early villages of the Hohokam.One of the earlier cultures in the presentday United States was the Clovis culture, who are primarily identified by the use of fluted spear points called the Clovis point. From , to , BCE, the culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in  near Clovis, New Mexico. The Folsom culture was similar, but is marked by the use of the Folsom point.A later migration identified by linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists occurred around , BCE. This included NaDenespeaking peoples, who reached the Pacific Northwest by , BCE. From there, they migrated along the Pacific Coast and into the interior and constructed large multifamily dwellings in their villages, which were used only seasonally in the summer to hunt and fish, and in the winter to gather food supplies. Another group, the Oshara tradition people, who lived from , BCE to  CE, were part of the Archaic Southwest.Mound builders and pueblosedit The First Corn, folktale from the Pawnee people. Maize was the staple crop for Native American agriculture.Main articles Mound Builders and Ancestral Puebloans Grave Creek Mound, located in Moundsville, West Virginia, is one of the largest conical mounds in the United States. It was built by the Adena culture. Monks Mound of Cahokia UNESCO World Heritage Site in summer Cliff Palace, Mesa Verde National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage SiteThe Adena began constructing large earthwork mounds around  BCE. They are the earliest known people to have been Mound Builders, however, there are mounds in the United States that predate this culture. Watson Brake is an mound complex in Louisiana that dates to , BCE, and nearby Poverty Point, built by the Poverty Point culture, is an earthwork complex that dates to , BCE. These mounds likely served a religious purpose.The Adenans were absorbed into the Hopewell tradition, a powerful people who traded tools and goods across a wide territory. They continued the Adena tradition of moundbuilding, with remnants of several thousand still in existence across the core of their former territory in southern Ohio. The Hopewell pioneered a trading system called the Hopewell Exchange System, which at its greatest extent ran from the presentday Southeast up to the Canadian side of Lake Ontario. By  CE, the Hopewellians had too disappeared, absorbed into the larger Mississippian culture.The Mississippians were a broad group of tribes. Their most important city was Cahokia, near modernday St. Louis, Missouri. At its peak in the th century, the city had an estimated population of ,, larger than the population of London at the time. The entire city was centered around a mound that stood  feet m tall. Cahokia, like many other cities and villages of the time, depended on hunting, foraging, trading, and agriculture, and developed a class system with slaves and human sacrifice that was influenced by societies to the south, like the Mayans.In the Southwest, the Anasazi began constructing stone and adobe pueblos around  BCE. These apartmentlike structures were often built into cliff faces, as seen in the Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde. Some grew to be the size of cities, with Pueblo Bonito along the Chaco River in New Mexico once consisting of  rooms.Northwest and northeasteditMain articles Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast The Kalyaan Totem pole of the Tlingit Kiks.di Clan, erected at Sitka National Historical Park to commemorate the lives lost in the  Battle of SitkaThe indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest were likely the most affluent Native Americans. Many distinct cultural groups and political entities developed there, but they all shared certain beliefs, traditions, and practices, such as the centrality of salmon as a resource and spiritual symbol. Permanent villages began to develop in this region as early as , BCE, and these communities celebrated by the giftgiving feast of the potlatch. These gatherings were usually organized to commemorate special events such as the raising of a Totem pole or the celebration of a new chief.In presentday upstate New York, the Iroquois formed a confederacy of tribal peoples in the midth century, consisting of the Oneida, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies. Each tribe had seats in a group of  sachem chiefs. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the United States government. The Iroquois were powerful, waging war with many neighboring tribes, and later, Europeans. As their territory expanded, smaller tribes were forced further west, including the Osage, Kaw, Ponca, and Omaha peoples.Native HawaiianseditMain articles Ancient Hawaii and Hawaiian KingdomThe exact date for the settling of Hawaii is disputed but the first settlement most likely took place between  and  CE. Around  CE, Tahitian explorers found and began settling the area as well establishing a new caste system. This marked the rise of the Hawaiian civilization, which would be largely separated from the rest of the world until the arrival of the British  years later. Europeans under the British explorer James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in , and within five years of contact, European military technology would help Kamehameha I conquer most of the island group, and eventually unify the islands for the first time establishing the Hawaiian Kingdom.Puerto RicoeditMain articles History of Puerto Rico and TainoThe island of Puerto Rico has been settled for at least for , years dating back to the remains of Puerto Ferro man. Starting with the Ortoiroid culture, successive generations of native migrations arrived replacing or absorbing local populations. By the year  Arawak people had arrived from South America via the Lesser Antilles, these settlers would become the Tano encountered by the Spanish in . Upon European contact a native population between , and , was likely, led by a single chief called a Cacique. Colonization resulted in the decimation of the local inhabitants due to the harsh Encomienda system and epidemics caused by Old World diseases. Puerto Rico would remain a part of Spain until American annexation in .Norse explorationeditMain article Norse colonization of North America Leiv Eirikson Discovering America by Christian Krohg, The earliest recorded European mention of America is in a historical treatise by the medieval chronicler Adam of Bremen, circa , where it is referred to as Vinland.a It is also extensively referred to in the thcentury Norse Vinland sagas, which relate to events which occurred around . Whilst the strongest archaeological evidence of the existence of Norse settlements in America is located in Canada, most notably at LAnse aux Meadows and dated to circa , there is significant scholarly debate as to whether Norse explorers also made landfall in New England and other eastcoast areas. In , President Calvin Coolidge declared that a Norse explorer called Leif Erikson c.  c. was the first European to discover America.European colonizationeditMain article Colonial history of the United States European territorial claims in North America, c.  France Great Britain SpainAfter a period of exploration sponsored by major European states, the first successful English settlement was established in . Europeans brought horses, cattle, and hogs to the Americas and, in turn, took back maize, turkeys, tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco, beans, and squash to Europe. Many explorers and early settlers died after being exposed to new diseases in the Americas. However, the effects of new Eurasian diseases carried by the colonists, especially smallpox and measles, were much worse for the Native Americans, as they had no immunity to them. They suffered epidemics and died in very large numbers, usually before largescale European settlement began. Their societies were disrupted and hollowed out by the scale of deaths.First settlementseditMain article European colonization of the AmericasSpanish contacteditMain article Spanish colonization of the AmericasSpanish explorers were the first Europeans to reach the presentday United States, after Christopher Columbuss expeditions beginning in  established possessions in the Caribbean, including the modernday U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, and parts of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Juan Ponce de Len landed in Florida in . Spanish expeditions quickly reached the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon, and the Great Plains. The Letter of Christopher Columbus on the Discovery of America to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of SpainIn , Hernando de Soto extensively explored the Southeast, and a year later Francisco Coronado explored from Arizona to central Kansas in search of gold. Escaped horses from Coronados party spread over the Great Plains, and the Plains Indians mastered horsemanship within a few generations. Small Spanish settlements eventually grew to become important cities, such as San Antonio, Albuquerque, Tucson, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.Dutch midAtlanticeditMain article Dutch colonization of the AmericasThe Dutch West India Company sent explorer Henry Hudson to search for a Northwest Passage to Asia in . New Netherland was established in  by the company to capitalize on the North American fur trade. Growth was slow at first due to mismanagement by the Dutch and Native American conflicts. After the Dutch purchased the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans for a reported price of US, the land was named New Amsterdam and became the capital of New Netherland. The town rapidly expanded and in the mids it became an important trading center and port. Despite being Calvinists and building the Reformed Church in America, the Dutch were tolerant of other religions and cultures and traded with the Iroquois to the north.The colony served as a barrier to British expansion from New England, and as a result a series of wars were fought. The colony was taken over by Britain as New York in  and its capital was renamed New York City. New Netherland left an enduring legacy on American cultural and political life of religious tolerance and sensible trade in urban areas and rural traditionalism in the countryside typified by the story of Rip Van Winkle. Notable Americans of Dutch descent include Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt and the Frelinghuysens.Swedish settlementeditMain article New SwedenIn the early years of the Swedish Empire, Swedish, Dutch, and German stockholders formed the New Sweden Company to trade furs and tobacco in North America. The companys first expedition was led by Peter Minuit, who had been governor of New Netherland from  to  but left after a dispute with the Dutch government, and landed in Delaware Bay in March . The settlers founded Fort Christina at the site of modernday Wilmington, Delaware, and made treaties with the indigenous groups for land ownership on both sides of the Delaware River.Over the following seventeen years,  more expeditions brought settlers from the Swedish Empire which also included contemporary Finland, Estonia, and portions of Latvia, Norway, Russia, Poland, and Germany to New Sweden. The colony established  permanent settlements along with many farms, extending into modernday Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It was incorporated into New Netherland in  after a Dutch invasion from the neighboring New Netherland colony during the Second Northern War.French and Spanish conflicteditGiovanni da Verrazzano landed in North Carolina in , and was the first European to sail into New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay. A decade later, Jacques Cartier sailed in search of the Northwest Passage, but instead discovered the Saint Lawrence River and laid the foundation for French colonization of the Americas in New France. After the collapse of the first Quebec colony in the s, French Huguenots settled at Fort Caroline near presentday Jacksonville in Florida. In , Spanish forces led by Pedro Menndez destroyed the settlement and established the first European settlement in what would become the United States  St. Augustine.After this, the French mostly remained in Quebec and Acadia, but farreaching trade relationships with Native Americans throughout the Great Lakes and Midwest spread their influence. French colonists in small villages along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers lived in farming communities that served as a grain source for Gulf Coast settlements. The French established plantations in Louisiana along with settling New Orleans, Mobile and Biloxi.British colonieseditFurther information British colonization of the Americas The Mayflower, which transported Pilgrims to the New World. During the first winter at Plymouth, about half of the Pilgrims died.The English, drawn in by Francis Drakes raids on Spanish treasure ships leaving the New World, settled the strip of land along the east coast in the s. The first British colony in North America was established at Roanoke by Walter Raleigh in , but failed. It would be twenty years before another attempt.The early British colonies were established by private groups seeking profit, and were marked by starvation, disease, and Native American attacks. Many immigrants were people seeking religious freedom or escaping political oppression, peasants displaced by the Industrial Revolution, or those simply seeking adventure and opportunity.In some areas, Native Americans taught colonists how to plant and harvest the native crops. In others, they attacked the settlers. Virgin forests provided an ample supply of building material and firewood. Natural inlets and harbors lined the coast, providing easy ports for essential trade with Europe. Settlements remained close to the coast due to this as well as Native American resistance and the Appalachian Mountains that were found in the interior.First settlement in JamestowneditMain articles Jamestown, Virginia and Colony of Virginia Squanto, known for having been an early liaison between the native populations in Southern New England and the Mayflower settlersThe first successful English colony, Jamestown, was established by the Virginia Company in  on the James River in Virginia. The colonists were preoccupied with the search for gold and were illequipped for life in the New World. Captain John Smith held the fledgling Jamestown together in the first year, and the colony descended into anarchy and nearly failed when he returned to England two years later. John Rolfe began experimenting with tobacco from the West Indies in , and by  the first shipment arrived in London. It became Virginias chief source of revenue within a decade.In , after years of disease and Indian attacks, including the Powhatan attack of , King James I revoked the Virginia Companys charter and made Virginia a royal colony.New England ColonieseditMain articles New England Colonies and Puritan migration to New England  The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth, , Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, MassachusettsNew England was initially settled primarily by Puritans fleeing religious persecution. The Pilgrims sailed for Virginia on the Mayflower in , but were knocked off course by a storm and landed at Plymouth, where they agreed to a social contract of rules in the Mayflower Compact. Like Jamestown, Plymouth suffered from disease and starvation, but local Wampanoag Indians taught the colonists how to farm maize.Plymouth was followed by the Puritans and Massachusetts Bay Colony in . They maintained a charter for selfgovernment separate from England, and elected founder John Winthrop as the governor for most of its early years. Roger Williams opposed Winthrops treatment of Native Americans and religious intolerance, and established the colony of Providence Plantations, later Rhode Island, on the basis of freedom of religion. Other colonists established settlements in the Connecticut River Valley, and on the coasts of presentday New Hampshire and Maine. Native American attacks continued, with the most significant occurring in the  Pequot War and the  King Philips War.New England became a center of commerce and industry due to the poor, mountainous soil making agriculture difficult. Rivers were harnessed to power grain mills and sawmills, and the numerous harbors facilitated trade. Tightknit villages developed around these industrial centers, and Boston became one of Americas most important ports.Middle ColonieseditMain article Middle Colonies Indians trade packs of furs at a Hudsons Bay Company trading post in the th century.In the s, the Middle Colonies of New York, New Jersey, and Delaware were established in the former Dutch New Netherland, and were characterized by a large degree of ethnic and religious diversity. At the same time, the Iroquois of New York, strengthened by years of fur trading with Europeans, formed the powerful Iroquois Confederacy.The last colony in this region was Pennsylvania, established in  by William Penn as a home for religious dissenters, including Quakers, Methodists, and the Amish. The capital of the colony, Philadelphia, became a dominant commercial center in a few short years, with busy docks and brick houses. While Quakers populated the city, German immigrants began to flood into the Pennsylvanian hills and forests, while the ScotsIrish pushed into the far western frontier.Southern ColonieseditMain article Southern Colonies The Indian massacre of Jamestown settlers in . Soon the colonists in the South feared all natives as enemies.The overwhelmingly rural Southern Colonies contrasted sharply with the New England and Middle Colonies. After Virginia, the second British colony south of New England was Maryland, established as a Catholic haven in . The economy of these two colonies was built entirely on yeoman farmers and planters. The planters established themselves in the Tidewater region of Virginia, establishing massive plantations with slave labor.In , the Province of Carolina was established, and Charleston became the regions great trading port. While Virginias economy was also based on tobacco, Carolina was more diversified, exporting rice, indigo, and lumber as well. In , it was divided in two, creating North and South Carolina. The Georgia Colony  the last of the Thirteen Colonies  was established by James Oglethorpe in  as a border to Spanish Florida and a reform colony for former prisoners and the poor.ReligioneditMain article History of religion in the United States John Gadsby Chapman, Baptism of Pocahontas , on display in the Rotunda of the U.S. CapitolReligiosity expanded greatly after the First Great Awakening, a religious revival in the s which was led by preachers such as Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. American Evangelicals affected by the Awakening added a new emphasis on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted new believers with an intense love for God. Revivals encapsulated those hallmarks and carried the newly created evangelicalism into the early republic, setting the stage for the Second Great Awakening in the late s. In the early stages, evangelicals in the South, such as Methodists and Baptists, preached for religious freedom and abolition of slavery they converted many slaves and recognized some as preachers.GovernmenteditMain article Colonial government in the Thirteen ColoniesEach of the  American colonies had a slightly different governmental structure. Typically, a colony was ruled by a governor appointed from London who controlled the executive administration and relied upon a locally elected legislature to vote on taxes and make laws. By the th century, the American colonies were growing very rapidly as a result of low death rates along with ample supplies of land and food. The colonies were richer than most parts of Britain, and attracted a steady flow of immigrants, especially teenagers who arrived as indentured servants.Servitude and slaveryeditMain articles Indentured servitude in British America and Slavery in the colonial history of the United StatesOver half of all European immigrants to Colonial America arrived as indentured servants. Few could afford the cost of the journey to America, and so this form of unfree labor provided a means to immigrate. Typically, people would sign a contract agreeing to a set term of labor, usually four to seven years, and in return would receive transport to America and a piece of land at the end of their servitude. In some cases, ships captains received rewards for the delivery of poor migrants, and so extravagant promises and kidnapping were common. The Virginia Company and the Massachusetts Bay Company also used indentured servant labor.The first African slaves were brought to Virginia in , just twelve years after the founding of Jamestown. Initially regarded as indentured servants who could buy their freedom, the institution of slavery began to harden and the involuntary servitude became lifelong as the demand for labor on tobacco and rice plantations grew in the s.citation needed Slavery became identified with brown skin color, at the time seen as a black race, and the children of slave women were born slaves partus sequitur ventrem. By the s African slaves comprised a fifth of the American population.The question of independence from Britain did not arise as long as the colonies needed British military support against the French and Spanish powers. Those threats were gone by . However, London continued to regard the American colonies as existing for the benefit of the mother country in a policy known as mercantilism.Colonial America was defined by a severe labor shortage that used forms of unfree labor, such as slavery and indentured servitude. The British colonies were also marked by a policy of avoiding strict enforcement of parliamentary laws, known as salutary neglect. This permitted the development of an American spirit distinct from that of its European founders.Road to independenceedit Map of the British, French and Spanish settlements in North America in , before the French and Indian WarAn upperclass emerged in South Carolina and Virginia, with wealth based on large plantations operated by slave labor. A unique class system operated in upstate New York, where Dutch tenant farmers rented land from very wealthy Dutch proprietors, such as the Van Rensselaer family. The other colonies were more egalitarian, with Pennsylvania being representative. By the midth century Pennsylvania was basically a middleclass colony with limited respect for its small upperclass. A writer in the Pennsylvania Journal in  wroteThe People of this Province are generally of the middling Sort, and at present pretty much upon a Level. They are chiefly industrious Farmers, Artificers or Men in Trade they enjoy in are fond of Freedom, and the meanest among them thinks he has a right to Civility from the greatest.Political integration and autonomyedit Join, or Die This  political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin urged the colonies to join during the French and Indian War.The French and Indian War , part of the larger Seven Years War, was a watershed event in the political development of the colonies. The influence of the French and Native Americans, the main rivals of the British Crown in the colonies and Canada, was significantly reduced and the territory of the Thirteen Colonies expanded into New France, both in Canada and Louisiana.citation needed The war effort also resulted in greater political integration of the colonies, as reflected in the Albany Congress and symbolized by Benjamin Franklins call for the colonies to Join, or Die. Franklin was a man of many inventions  one of which was the concept of a United States of America, which emerged after  and would be realized a decade later.Taxation without representationeditFurther information No taxation without representation An  painting of the  Boston Tea Party The population density in the American Colonies in Following Britains acquisition of French territory in North America, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of , with the goal of organizing the new North American empire and protecting the Native Americans from colonial expansion into western lands beyond the Appalachian Mountains. In the following years, strains developed in the relations between the colonists and the Crown. The British Parliament passed the Stamp Act of , imposing a tax on the colonies, without going through the colonial legislatures. The issue was drawn did Parliament have the right to tax Americans who were not represented in it Crying No taxation without representation, the colonists refused to pay the taxes as tensions escalated in the late s and early s.The Boston Tea Party in  was a direct action by activists in the town of Boston to protest against the new tax on tea. Parliament quickly responded the next year with the Intolerable Acts, stripping Massachusetts of its historic right of selfgovernment and putting it under military rule, which sparked outrage and resistance in all thirteen colonies. Patriot leaders from every colony convened the First Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance to the Intolerable Acts. The Congress called for a boycott of British trade, published a list of rights and grievances, and petitioned the king to rectify those grievances. This appeal to the Crown had no effect, though, and so the Second Continental Congress was convened in  to organize the defense of the colonies against the British Army.Common people became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of rights that they felt the British were deliberately violating  rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested by the arrival in Boston of the British Army to punish the Bostonians. This heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge, and they had faith that God was on their side.Revolution and independenceeditMain articles American Revolution and History of the United States See also Commemoration of the American RevolutionThe American Revolutionary War began at Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts in April  when the British tried to seize ammunition supplies and arrest the Patriot leaders.In terms of political values, the Americans were largely united on a concept called Republicanism, which rejected aristocracy and emphasized civic duty and a fear of corruption. For the Founding Fathers, according to one team of historians, republicanism represented more than a particular form of government. It was a way of life, a core ideology, an uncompromising commitment to liberty, and a total rejection of aristocracy. Reading of The Declaration of Independence originally written by Thomas Jefferson, presented on July ,  Washingtons surprise crossing of the Delaware River in December  was a major comeback after the loss of New York City his army defeated the British in two battles and recaptured New Jersey.The Thirteen Colonies began a rebellion against British rule in  and proclaimed their independence in  as the United States of America. In the American Revolutionary War  the Americans captured the British invasion army at Saratoga in , secured the Northeast and encouraged the French to make a military alliance with the United States. France brought in Spain and the Netherlands, thus balancing the military and naval forces on each side as Britain had no allies.George WashingtoneditMain article Military career of George WashingtonGeneral George Washington proved an excellent organizer and administrator who worked successfully with Congress and the state governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics because neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers.As a battlefield tactician, Washington often was outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washingtons strategy forced the first army out of Boston in , and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga  and Yorktown . He limited the British control to New York City and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population.Loyalists and BritaineditMain article Loyalist American Revolution John Trumbulls Declaration of Independence The Loyalists, whom the British counted upon heavily, comprised about  of the population but suffered weak organization. As the war ended, the final British army sailed out of New York City in November , taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington unexpectedly then, instead of seizing power for himself, retired to his farm in Virginia. Political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset observes, The United States was the first major colony successfully to revolt against colonial rule. In this sense, it was the first new nation.Declaration of IndependenceeditMain article United States Declaration of Independence The United States after the Treaty of Paris , with individual state claims and cessions through On July , , the Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, declared the independence of the colonies by adopting the resolution from Richard Henry Lee, that statedThat these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers, and a Confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together.On July , , they adopted the Declaration of Independence and this date is celebrated as the countrys birthday. Congress shortly thereafter officially changed the name of the union to the United States of America from the United Colonies of America.The new country was founded on Enlightenment ideals of liberalism and what Thomas Jefferson called the unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It was dedicated strongly to republican principles, which emphasized that people are sovereign not hereditary kings, demanded civic duty, feared corruption, and rejected any aristocracy.Early years of the republiceditMain articles Confederation period and History of the United States See also First Party System and Second Party SystemConfederation and constitutioneditMain articles Articles of Confederation and History of the United States Constitution Reading of the United States Constitution of  Economic growth in America per capita income. Index with  set as .In the s the national government was able to settle the issue of the western regions of the young United States, which were ceded by the states to Congress and became territories. With the migration of settlers to the Northwest, soon they became states. Nationalists worried that the confederate nature of the union was too fragile to withstand an armed conflict with any adversarial states, or even internal revolts such as the Shays Rebellion of  in Massachusetts.Nationalists  most of them war veterans  organized in every state and convinced Congress to call the Philadelphia Convention in . The delegates from every state wrote a new Constitution that created a much more powerful and efficient central government, one with a strong president, and powers of taxation. The new government reflected the prevailing republican ideals of guarantees of individual liberty and of constraining the power of government through a system of separation of powers.The Congress was given authority to ban the international slave trade after  years which it did in . The Threefifths Compromise gave the South Congressional apportionment out of proportion to its free population by allowing it to include threefifths of the number of slaves in each states total population. This provision increased the political power of southern representatives in the United States Congress, especially as slavery was extended into the Deep South through removal of Native Americans and transportation of slaves by an extensive domestic slave trade.To assuage the AntiFederalists who feared a toopowerful central government, the Congress adopted the United States Bill of Rights in . Comprising the first ten amendments of the Constitution, it guaranteed individual liberties such as freedom of speech and religious practice, jury trials, and stated that citizens and states had reserved rights which were not specified.President George WashingtoneditMain article Presidency of George Washington George Washingtons legacy remains among the greatest in American history, as CommanderinChief of the Continental Army, hero of the Revolution, and the first President of the United States by Gilbert Charles Stuart Reading of the Farewell address of President George Washington, George Washington  a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, commanderinchief of the Continental Army, and president of the Constitutional Convention  became the first President of the United States under the new Constitution in . The national capital moved from New York to Philadelphia in  and finally settled in Washington D.C. in .The major accomplishments of the Washington Administration were creating a strong national government that was recognized without question by all Americans. His government, following the vigorous leadership of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, assumed the debts of the states the debt holders received federal bonds, created the Bank of the United States to stabilize the financial system, and set up a uniform system of tariffs taxes on imports and other taxes to pay off the debt and provide a financial infrastructure. To support his programs Hamilton created a new political party  the first in the world based on votersvague  the Federalist Party.Twoparty systemeditMain article First Party System Depiction of electionday activities in Philadelphia by John Lewis Krimmel, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison formed an opposition Republican Party usually called the DemocraticRepublican Party by political scientists. Hamilton and Washington presented the country in  with the Jay Treaty that reestablished good relations with Britain. The Jeffersonians vehemently protested, and the voters aligned behind one party or the other, thus setting up the First Party System. Federalists promoted business, financial and commercial interests and wanted more trade with Britain. Republicans accused the Federalists of plans to establish a monarchy, turn the rich into a ruling class, and making the United States a pawn of the British. The treaty passed, but politics became intensely heated.Challenges to the federal governmenteditSerious challenges to the new federal government included the Northwest Indian War, the ongoing CherokeeAmerican wars, and the  Whiskey Rebellion, in which western settlers protested against a federal tax on liquor. Washington called the state militia and personally led an army against the settlers, as the insurgents melted away and the power of the federal government was firmly established.Washington refused to serve more than two terms  setting a precedent  and in his famous farewell address, he extolled the benefits of federal government and importance of ethics and morality while warning against foreign alliances and the formation of political parties.John Adams, a Federalist, defeated Jefferson in the  election. War loomed with France and the Federalists used the opportunity to try to silence the Republicans with the Alien and Sedition Acts, build up a large army with Hamilton at the head, and prepare for a French invasion. However, the Federalists became divided after Adams sent a successful peace mission to France that ended the QuasiWar of .Increasing demand for slave laboreditMain article Slavery in the United States Slaves Waiting for Sale Richmond, Virginia by Eyre CroweDuring the first two decades after the Revolutionary War, there were dramatic changes in the status of slavery among the states and an increase in the number of freed blacks. Inspired by revolutionary ideals of the equality of men and influenced by their lesser economic reliance on slavery, northern states abolished slavery.States of the Upper South made manumission easier, resulting in an increase in the proportion of free blacks in the Upper South as a percentage of the total nonwhite population from less than one percent in  to more than  percent by . By that date, a total of . percent of all blacks in the United States were free. After that date, with the demand for slaves on the rise because of the Deep Souths expanding cotton cultivation, the number of manumissions declined sharply and an internal U.S. slave trade became an important source of wealth for many planters and traders.In , Congress severed the U.S.s involvement with the Atlantic slave trade.Louisiana and Jeffersonian republicanismeditMain articles Presidency of Thomas Jefferson and Louisiana Purchase Thomas Jefferson saw himself as a man of the frontier and a scientist he was keenly interested in expanding and exploring the West. Territorial expansion Louisiana Purchase in white Chapter IV of The Journal of Lewis and Clarke , describes the upper Missouri River and its tributariesJefferson defeated Adams massively for the presidency in the  election. Jeffersons major achievement as president was the Louisiana Purchase in , which provided U.S. settlers with vast potential for expansion west of the Mississippi River.Jefferson, a scientist, supported expeditions to explore and map the new domain, most notably the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jefferson believed deeply in republicanism and argued it should be based on the independent yeoman farmer and planter he distrusted cities, factories and banks. He also distrusted the federal government and judges, and tried to weaken the judiciary. However he met his match in John Marshall, a Federalist from Virginia. Although the Constitution specified a Supreme Court, its functions were vague until Marshall, the Chief Justice of the United States , defined them, especially the power to overturn acts of Congress or states that violated the Constitution, first enunciated in  in Marbury v. Madison.War of editMain article War of Americans were increasingly angry at the British violation of American ships neutral rights to hurt France, the impressment seizure of , American sailors needed by the Royal Navy to fight Napoleon, and British support for hostile Indians attacking American settlers in the American Midwest with the goal of creating a proBritish Indian barrier state to block American expansion westward. They may also have desired to annex all or part of British North America, although this is still heavily debated. Despite strong opposition from the Northeast, especially from Federalists who did not want to disrupt trade with Britain, Congress declared war on June , . Oliver Hazard Perrys message to William Henry Harrison after the Battle of Lake Erie began with We have met the enemy and they are ours by William H. Powell, The war was frustrating for both sides. Both sides tried to invade the other and were repulsed. The American high command remained incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada, while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.The British raided and burned Washington, but were repelled at Baltimore in   where the Star Spangled Banner was written to celebrate the American success. In upstate New York a major British invasion of New York State was turned back at the Battle of Plattsburgh. Finally in early  Andrew Jackson decisively defeated a major British invasion at the Battle of New Orleans, making him the most famous war hero.With Napoleon apparently gone, the causes of the war had evaporated and both sides agreed to a peace that left the prewar boundaries intact. Americans claimed victory on February , , as news came almost simultaneously of Jacksons victory of New Orleans and the peace treaty that left the prewar boundaries in place. Americans swelled with pride at success in the second war of independence the naysayers of the antiwar Federalist Party were put to shame and the party never recovered. This helped lead to an emerging American identity that cemented national pride over state pride.Britain never achieved the war goal of granting the Indians a barrier state to block further American settlement and this allowed settlers to pour into the Midwest without fear of a major threat. The War of  also destroyed Americas negative perception of a standing army, which was proved useful in many areas against the British as opposed to illequipped and poorlytrained militias in the early months of the war, and War Department officials instead decided to place regular troops as the main military capabilities of the government.Second Great AwakeningeditMain article Second Great Awakening A drawing of a Protestant camp meeting by H. Bridport, c. The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant revival movement that affected virtually all of society during the early th century and led to rapid church growth. The movement began around , gained momentum by , and, after  membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the s.It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements  including abolitionism and temperance designed to remove the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ.Era of Good FeelingseditMain article Era of Good FeelingsAs strong opponents of the War of , the Federalists held the Hartford Convention in  that hinted at disunion. National euphoria after the victory at New Orleans ruined the prestige of the Federalists and they no longer played a significant role as a political party. President Madison and most Republicans realized they were foolish to let the First Bank of the United States close down, for its absence greatly hindered the financing of the war. So, with the assistance of foreign bankers, they chartered the Second Bank of the United States in . Settlers crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen, th centuryThe Republicans also imposed tariffs designed to protect the infant industries that had been created when Britain was blockading the U.S. With the collapse of the Federalists as a party, the adoption of many Federalist principles by the Republicans, and the systematic policy of President James Monroe in his two terms  to downplay partisanship, society entered an Era of Good Feelings, with far less partisanship than before or after, and closed out the First Party System.The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in , proclaimed the United States opinion that European powers should no longer colonize or interfere in the Americas. This was a defining moment in the foreign policy of the United States. The Monroe Doctrine was adopted in response to American and British fears over Russian and French expansion into the Western Hemisphere.In , President Andrew Jackson, th President of the United States, ran for a second term under the slogan Jackson and no bank and did not renew the charter of the Second Bank, dissolving the bank in . Jackson was convinced that central banking was used by the elite to take advantage of the average American, and instead implemented publicly owned banks in various states, popularly known as pet banks.Westward expansioneditIndian removaleditMain article Indian removal The Indian Removal Act resulted in the transplantation of several Native American tribes and the Trail of Tears.In , Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River. Its goal was primarily to remove Native Americans, including the Five Civilized Tribes, from the American Southeast  they occupied land that settlers wanted.Jacksonian Democrats demanded the forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state laws to reservations in the West. Whigs and religious leaders opposed the move as inhumane. Thousands of deaths resulted from the relocations, as seen in the Cherokee Trail of Tears. The Trail of Tears resulted in approximately ,, of the , relocated Cherokee perishing along the way.full citation needed Many of the Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west they fought the Army for years in the Seminole Wars.Second party systemeditMain articles Second Party System and Presidency of Andrew JacksonAfter the First Party System of Federalists and Republicans withered away in the s, the stage was set for the emergence of a new party system based on well organized local parties that appealed for the votes of almost all adult white men. The former Jeffersonian DemocraticRepublican party split into factions. They split over the choice of a successor to President James Monroe, and the party faction that supported many of the old Jeffersonian principles, led by Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, became the Democratic Party. As Norton explains the transformation in Jacksonians believed the peoples will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nations first wellorganized national party, and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenthcentury American politics. Horace Greeleys New York Tribunethe leading Whig paperendorsed Clay for President and Fillmore for Governor, .Opposing factions led by Henry Clay helped form the Whig Party. The Democratic Party had a small but decisive advantage over the Whigs until the s, when the Whigs fell apart over the issue of slavery.The great majority of antislavery activists, such as Abraham Lincoln and Mr. Walters, rejected Garrisons theology and held that slavery was an unfortunate social evil, not a sin.Westward expansion and Manifest DestinyeditMain articles American frontier and Manifest destinyThe American colonies and the newly formed union grew rapidly in population and area, as pioneers pushed the frontier of settlement west. The process finally ended around  as the last major farmlands and ranch lands were settled. Native American tribes in some places resisted militarily, but they were overwhelmed by settlers and the army and after  were relocated to reservations in the west. The highly influential Frontier thesis of Wisconsin historian Frederick Jackson Turner argues that the frontier shaped the national character, with its boldness, violence, innovation, individualism, and democracy. The California Gold Rush news of gold brought some , people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.Recent historians have emphasized the multicultural nature of the frontier. Enormous popular attention in the media focuses on the Wild West of the second half of the th century. As defined by Hine and Faragher, frontier history tells the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the land, the development of markets, and the formation of states. They explain, It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America.The first settlers in the west were the Spanish in New Mexico they became U.S. citizens in . The Hispanics in California Californios were overwhelmed by over , California Gold Rush miners. California grew explosively. San Francisco by  had become the economic hub of the entire Pacific Coast with a diverse population of a quarter million.From the early s to , the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by over , settlers. ers in the California Gold Rush, ranchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs and their families headed to California, Oregon, and other points in the far west. Wagontrains took five or six months on foot after , the trip took  days by rail.Manifest destiny was the belief that American settlers were destined to expand across the continent. This concept was born out of A sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven. Manifest Destiny was rejected by modernizers, especially the Whigs like Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln who wanted to build cities and factories  not more farms.b Democrats strongly favored expansion, and won the key election of . After a bitter debate in Congress the Republic of Texas was annexed in , leading to war with Mexico, who considered Texas to be a part of Mexico due to the large numbers of Mexican settlers. The American occupation of Mexico City in The MexicanAmerican War  broke out with the Whigs opposed to the war, and the Democrats supporting the war. The U.S. army, using regulars and large numbers of volunteers, defeated the Mexican armies, invaded at several points, captured Mexico City and won decisively. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war in . Many Democrats wanted to annex all of Mexico, but that idea was rejected by White Southerners who argued that by incorporating millions of Mexican people, mainly of mixed race, would undermine the United States as an exclusively white republic.Instead the U.S. took Texas and the lightly settled northern parts California and New Mexico. The Hispanic residents were given full citizenship and the Mexican Indians became American Indians. Simultaneously, gold was discovered in California in , attracting over , people to northern California in a matter of months in the California Gold Rush. Thousands of California Indians were killed by U.S. government agents or settlers in the decades after the U.S. took California in what has since been termed the California genocide. A peaceful compromise with Britain gave the U.S. ownership of the Oregon Country, which was renamed the Oregon Territory.The demand for guano prized as an agricultural fertilizer led the United States to pass the Guano Islands Act in , which enabled citizens of the United States to take possession, in the name of the United States, of unclaimed islands containing guano deposits. Under the act the United States annexed nearly  islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. By ,  of these islands were recognized as territories of the United States.Sectional conflict and Civil WareditDivisions between North and SoutheditMain articles Origins of the American Civil War and History of the United States  United States map,   Union states  Union territories not permitting slavery  Border Union states, permitting slavery  Confederate states  Union territories permitting slavery claimed by Confederacy Frederick Douglass circa  Excerpt of Narrative of the life of Frederick Douglas, a major inspiration to American Abolitionist Movement. Warning file contains explicit language.The central issue after  was the expansion of slavery, with the antislavery elements in the North pitted against the proslavery elements that dominated the South. A small number of active Northerners were abolitionists who declared that ownership of slaves was a sin in terms of Protestant theology and demanded its immediate abolition. Much larger numbers in the North were against the expansion of slavery, seeking to put it on the path to extinction so that America would be committed to free land as in lowcost farms owned and cultivated by a family, free labor, and free speech as opposed to censorship of abolitionist material in the South. Southern white Democrats insisted that slavery was of economic, social, and cultural benefit to all whites and even to the slaves themselves, and denounced all antislavery spokesmen as abolitionists.Justifications of slavery included economics, history, religion, legality, social good, and even humanitarianism. Defenders of slavery argued that the sudden end to the slave economy would have had a profound and fatal economic impact in the South where reliance on slave labor was the foundation of their economy. They also argued that if all the slaves were freed, there would be widespread unemployment and chaos.Religious activists were split on slavery, with the Methodists and Baptists dividing into northern and southern denominations. In the North, the Methodists, Congregationalists, and Quakers included many abolitionists, especially among women activists. The Catholic, Episcopal and Lutheran denominations largely ignored the slavery issue.Compromise of  and popular sovereigntyeditMain article Compromise of The issue of slavery in the new territories was seemingly settled by the Compromise of , brokered by Whig Henry Clay and Democrat Stephen Douglas the Compromise included the admission of California as a free state in exchange for no federal restrictions on slavery placed on Utah or New Mexico. A point of contention was the Fugitive Slave Act, which increased federal enforcement and required even free states to cooperate in turning over fugitive slaves to their owners. Abolitionists highlighted the Act as particularly harmful in their fight against slavery, as evinced in the bestselling antislavery novel Uncle Toms Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe.The Compromise of  was repealed in  with the KansasNebraska Act, promoted by Senator Douglas in the name of popular sovereignty and democracy. It permitted voters to decide on the legality of slavery in each territory, and allowed Douglas to adopt neutrality on the issue of slavery. Antislavery forces rose in anger and alarm, forming the new Republican Party. Pro and anti contingents rushed to Kansas to vote slavery up or down, resulting in a miniature civil war called Bleeding Kansas. By the late s, the young Republican Party dominated nearly all northern states and thus the electoral college. It insisted that slavery would never be allowed to expand and thus would slowly die out.Plantation economyeditMain article Plantation complexes in the Southern United StatesThe Southern slaverybased societies had become wealthy based on their cotton and other agricultural commodity production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including textile mills. By , there were four million slaves in the South, nearly eight times as many as there were nationwide in . The plantations were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves largely drawn from the declining tobacco regions.For the  of the countrys first  years, a slaveholder served as President of the United States and, during that period, only slaveholding presidents were reelected to second terms. In addition, southern states benefited by their increased apportionment in Congress due to the partial counting of slaves in their populations.Slave rebellions and AbolitionismeditMain articles Abolitionism, Dred Scott Decision, and Dred Scott v. SandfordThere was resistance to slavery by both peaceful and violent means. Slave rebellions, by Gabriel Prosser , Denmark Vesey , Nat Turner , and most famously by John Brown , caused fear in the white South, which imposed stricter oversight of slaves and reduced the rights of free blacks. Abolitionism grew in the north in the decades before the Civil War, while southern states entrenched themselves on upholding slavery fiercely. Former slaves Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman became leading advocates for abolition. However, before  only a minority of northern whites supported abolition, which was often seen as a radical measure. There were violent reactions to abolitionist advocates in the north, notably the burning of an anti slavery society in Pennsylvania Hall.With political power in congress being a key flashpoint between slave and free states The Fugitive Slave Act of  required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a nonslave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the Missouri Compromise. The Supreme Courts  decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that free blacks were not citizens of the United States the decision enraged all major political forces except for southern states. The Republicans worried the decision could be used to expand slavery throughout all states and territories. With senator Abraham Lincoln leading criticism of the ruling, the stage was set for the  presidential election.President Abraham Lincoln and secessioneditMain articles Abraham Lincoln,  United States presidential election, and Confederate States of AmericaAfter Abraham Lincoln won the  election, seven Southern states seceded from the union and set up a newly formed sovereign state, the Confederate States of America Confederacy, on February , . It attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. Army fort in South Carolina, thus igniting the war. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the Confederacy in April , four more states seceded and joined the Confederacy. A few of the northernmost slave states did not secede and became known as the border states these were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.During the war, the northwestern portion of Virginia seceded from the Confederacy. and became the new Union state of West Virginia. West Virginia is usually associated with the border states.Civil WareditMain article American Civil War Officers and soldiers of the IrishCatholic th New York Volunteer Regiment attend Catholic services in . The Battle of Franklin, November , The Civil War began April , , when Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. In response, Lincoln called on the states to send troops to recapture forts, protect the capital, and preserve the Union, which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. The two armies had their first major clash at the First Battle of Bull Run, which proved to both sides that the war would be much longer and bloodier than originally anticipated. Lincoln with Allan Pinkerton and Major General John Alexander McClernand at the Battle of AntietamIn the western theater, the Union Army was relatively successful, with major battles, such as Perryville and Shiloh along with Union Navy gunboat dominance of navigable rivers producing strategic Union victories and destroying major Confederate operations. Modern recording of Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg AddressWarfare in the eastern theater began poorly for the Union. U.S. General George B. McClellan failed to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia in his Peninsula campaign and retreated after attacks from Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Meanwhile, both sides concentrated in  on raising and training new armies. The main action was Union success in controlling the border states, with Confederates largely driven out of border states.The autumn  Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam led to Lincolns warning he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January  if the states did not return. Making slavery a central war goal energized Republicans in the North, as well as their enemies, the antiwar Copperhead Democrats and ended the chance of British and French intervention.Lees smaller Army of Northern Virginia won battles in late  and Spring , but he pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause warweariness in the North. In perhaps the turning point of the war, Lees army was badly beaten by the Army of the Potomac at the July  Battle of Gettysburg and barely made it back to Virginia. Survivors of the Battle of Gettysburg were immedietely redployed to supress the New York City draft riots by Irish Americans first resisting Civil War conscription but later out of racism aganist the citys free black population.In July , Union forces under General Ulysses S. Grant gained control of the Mississippi River at the Battle of Vicksburg, thereby splitting the Confederacy. In , Union General William Tecumseh Sherman marched south from Chattanooga to capture Atlanta, a decisive victory that ended war jitters among Republicans in the North and helped Lincoln win reelection.On the homefront, industrial expansion in the North expanded dramatically, using its extensive railroad service, and moving industrial workers into munitions factories. Foreign trade increased, with the United States providing both food and cotton to Britain, and Britain sending in manufactured products and thousands of volunteers for the Union Army plus a few to the Confederate army. The British operated blockade runners bringing in food, luxury items and munitions to the Confederacy, bringing out tobacco and cotton. The Union blockade increasingly shut down Confederate ports, and by late  the blockade runners were usually captured before they could make more than a handful of runs.The last two years of the war were bloody for both sides, with Sherman marching almost unopposed through southern states, burning cities, destroying plantations, ruining railroads and bridges, but avoiding civilian casualties. Sherman demonstrated that the South was unable to resist a Union invasion. Much of the Confederate heartland was destroyed, and could no longer provide desperately needed supplies to its armies. In spring , Grant launched a war of attrition and pursued Lee to the final, Appomattox campaign which resulted in Lee surrendering in April .The American Civil War was the worlds earliest industrial war. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and massproduced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in World War I. It remains the deadliest war in American history, resulting in the deaths of about , soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.c About ten percent of all Northern males  years old, and  percent of all Southern white males aged  died. Its legacy includes ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government.According to historian Allan Nevins, the Civil War had a major longterm impact on the United States in terms of developing its leadership potential and metaphorically moving the country beyond the adolescent stageThe fighting and its attendant demands upon industry, finance, medicine, and law also helped train a host of leaders who during the next  years, to , made their influence powerfully felt on most of the social, economic, and cultural fronts. It broke down barriers of parochialism it ended distrust of largescale effort it hardened and matured the whole people emotionally. The adolescent land of the srose under the blows of battle to adult estate. The nation of the postAppomattox generation, though sadly hurt especially in the South by war losses, and deeply scarred psychologically especially in the North by war hatreds and greeds, had at last the power, resolution, and selftrust of manhood.EmancipationeditSee also Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War, Emancipation Proclamation, and End of slavery in the United States of America First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln by Francis Bicknell CarpenterPeople in the image are clickable. Modern reading of President Abraham Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation of  giving freedom to all African Americans who resided within the Confederacy but not those within the Union.The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January , . In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of  million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from slave to free. It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free.The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June , the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves. Large numbers moved into camps run by the Freedmens Bureau, where they were given food, shelter, medical care, and arrangements for their employment were made.The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a large negative impact on the black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.ReconstructioneditMain article Reconstruction eraSee also History of the United States  Freedmen voting in New Orleans, Reconstruction lasted from Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation of January , , to the Compromise of .The major issues faced by Lincoln were the status of the exslaves Freedmen, the loyalty and civil rights of exrebels, the status of the  exConfederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions.The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the Freedmens Bureau, operated by the Army.Three Reconstruction Amendments were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks the Fifteenth Amendment prevented race from being used to disenfranchise men.Radical ReconstructioneditMain article Radical RepublicansExConfederates remained in control of most Southern states for over two years, but changed when the Radical Republicans gained control of Congress in the  elections. President Andrew Johnson, who sought easy terms for reunions with exrebels, was virtually powerless in the face of the Radical Republican Congress he was impeached, but the Senates attempt to remove him from office failed by one vote. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily stripped many exConfederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen made up of Carpetbaggers new arrivals from the North, and Scalawags native white Southerners. They were backed by the U.S. Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites.KKK and the rise of Jim Crow lawseditMain articles Ku Klux Klan, Jim Crow laws, and Nadir of American race relations Atlantas railyard and roundhouse in ruins shortly after the end of the Civil WarState by state, the New Republicans lost power to a conservativeDemocratic coalition, which gained control of the entire South by . In response to Radical Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan KKK emerged in  as a whitesupremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grants vigorous enforcement of the Ku Klux Klan Act of  shut down the Klan, and it disbanded.Paramilitary groups, such as the White League and Red Shirts emerged about  that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting to regain white political power in states across the South during the s. One historian described them as the military arm of the Democratic Party.Reconstruction ended after the disputed  election. The Compromise of  gave Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes the White House in exchange for removing all remaining federal troops in the South. The federal government withdrew its troops from the South, and Southern Democrats took control of every Southern state. In , the United States passed its first major exclusionary immigration acts, the Chinese Exclusion Act which barred all Chinese immigrants except for students and businessmen, and the Immigration Act of  which barred all immigrants with mental health issues.From  to , southern states effectively disfranchised most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other arbitrary devices. They passed segregation laws and imposed secondclass status on blacks in a system known as Jim Crow that lasted until the Civil rights movement.Growth and industrializationeditMain articles Gilded Age and Industrial Revolution in the United StatesFrontier and the railroadeditMain article History of rail transportation in the United States The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad  at First transcontinental railroad, by Andrew J.

Large numbers of European immigrants especially from Germany and Scandinavia took up lowcost or free farms in the Prairie States. Mining for silver and copper opened up the Mountain West.Indian warseditMain article American Indian WarsThe United States Army fought frequent smallscale wars with Native Americans as settlers encroached on their traditional lands. Gradually the U.S. purchased the Native American tribal lands and extinguished their claims, forcing most tribes onto subsidized reservations.

They have cost the lives of about , white men, women and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of about , Indians. The actual number of killed and wounded Indians must be very much higher than the given Fifty percent additional would be a safe estimate.Gilded AgeeditMain article Gilded Age Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie led the enormous expansion of the American steel industry.The Gilded Age was a term that Mark Twain used to describe the period of the late th century with a dramatic expansion of American wealth and prosperity, underscored by the mass corruption in the government. Reforms of the Age included the Civil Service Act, which mandated a competitive examination for applicants for government jobs. Other important legislation included the Interstate Commerce Act, which ended railroads discrimination against small shippers, and the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed monopolies in business. Twain believed that this age was corrupted by such elements as land speculators, scandalous politics, and unethical business practices.Since the days of Charles A. Beard and Matthew Josephson, some historians have argued that the United States was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. As financiers and industrialists such as J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller began to amass vast fortunes, many U.S. observers were concerned that the nation was losing its pioneering egalitarian spirit.By  American industrial production and per capita income exceeded those of all other countries. In response to heavy debts and decreasing farm prices, wheat and cotton farmers joined the Populist Party. An unprecedented wave of immigration from Europe served to both provide the labor for American industry and create diverse communities in previously undeveloped areas. From  to , peak years of immigration, more than  million people migrated to the United States.Most were unskilled workers who quickly found jobs in mines, mills, and factories. Many immigrants were craftsmen especially from Britain and Germany bringing human skills, and others were farmers especially from Germany and Scandinavia who purchased inexpensive land on the Prairies from railroads who sent agents to Europe. Poverty, growing inequality and dangerous working conditions, along with socialist and anarchist ideas diffusing from European immigrants, led to the rise of the labor movement, which often included violent strikes.Unions and strikeseditMain article Labor history of the United States Chapter  of The Jungle, a  muckracking novel by Upton Sinclair describing corruption in the Gilded AgeSkilled workers banded together to control their crafts and raise wages by forming labor unions in industrial areas of the Northeast. Before the s few factory workers joined the unions in the labor movement. Samuel Gompers led the American Federation of Labor , coordinating multiple unions. Industrial growth was rapid, led by John D. Rockefeller in oil and Andrew Carnegie in steel both became leaders of philanthropy Gospel of Wealth, giving away their fortunes to create the modern system of hospitals, universities, libraries, and foundations. Mulberry Street, along which Manhattans Little Italy is centered. Lower East Side, circa . Almost  of residents of the  largest American cities of  were nonHispanic whites.The Panic of  broke out and was a severe nationwide depression impacting farmers, workers, and businessmen who saw prices, wages, and profits fall. Many railroads went bankrupt. The resultant political reaction fell on the Democratic Party, whose leader President Grover Cleveland shouldered much of the blame. Labor unrest involved numerous strikes, most notably the violent Pullman Strike of , which was shut down by federal troops under Clevelands orders. The Populist Party gained strength among cotton and wheat farmers, as well as coal miners, but was overtaken by the even more popular Free silver movement, which demanded using silver to enlarge the money supply, leading to inflation that the silverites promised would end the depression.The financial, railroad, and business communities fought back hard, arguing that only the gold standard would save the economy. In the most intense election in U.S. history, conservative Republican William McKinley defeated silverite William Jennings Bryan, who ran on the Democratic, Populist, and Silver Republican tickets. Bryan swept the South and West, but McKinley ran up landslides among the middle class, industrial workers, cities, and among upscale farmers in the Midwest.Prosperity returned under McKinley, the gold standard was enacted, and the tariff was raised. By  the U.S. had the strongest economy on the globe. Apart from two short recessions in  and  the overall economy remained prosperous and growing until .

The American flag flies from the Philippines and Hawaii in the Pacific to Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.The United States emerged as a world economic and military power after . The main episode was the SpanishAmerican War, which began when Spain refused American demands to reform its oppressive policies in Cuba. The splendid little war, as one official called it, involved a series of quick American victories on land and at sea. At the Treaty of Paris peace conference the United States acquired the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam.Cuba became an independent country, under close American tutelage. Although the war itself was widely popular, the peace terms proved controversial. William Jennings Bryan led his Democratic Party in opposition to control of the Philippines, which he denounced as imperialism unbecoming to American democracy. President William McKinley defended the acquisition and was riding high as society had returned to prosperity and felt triumphant in the war. McKinley easily defeated Bryan in a rematch in the  presidential election.After defeating an insurrection by Filipino nationalists, the United States achieved little in the Philippines except in education, and it did something in the way of public health. It also built roads, bridges, and wells, but infrastructural development lost much of its early vigor with the failure of the railroads. By , however, Americans lost interest in an empire and turned their international attention to the Caribbean, especially the building of the Panama Canal. The canal opened in  and increased trade with Japan and the rest of the Far East. A key innovation was the Open Door Policy, whereby the imperial powers were given equal access to Chinese business, with not one of them allowed to take control of China.Discontent and reformeditProgressive eraeditMain article Progressive Era American children of many ethnic backgrounds celebrate noisily in a  Puck cartoon.Dissatisfaction on the part of the growing middle class with the corruption and inefficiency of politics as usual, and the failure to deal with increasingly important urban and industrial problems, led to the dynamic Progressive Movement starting in the s. In every major city and state, and at the federal level as well, and in education, medicine, and industry, the progressives called for the modernization and reform of decrepit institutions, the elimination of corruption in politics, and the introduction of efficiency as a criterion for change.Leading politicians from both parties, most notably Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Evans Hughes, and Robert La Follette on the Republican side, and William Jennings Bryan and Woodrow Wilson on the Democratic side, took up the cause of progressive reform. Women became especially involved in demands for female suffrage, prohibition, and better schools. Their most prominent leader was Jane Addams of Chicago, who created settlement houses.Muckraking journalists such as Upton Sinclair, Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis exposed corruption in business and government along with rampant innercity poverty. Progressives implemented antitrust laws and regulated such industries of meatpacking, drugs, and railroads. Four new constitutional amendments  the Sixteenth through Nineteenth  resulted from progressive activism, bringing the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and female suffrage.The period also saw a major transformation of the banking system with the creation of the Federal Reserve System in  and the arrival of cooperative banking in the US with the founding of the first credit union in . The Progressive Movement lasted through the s the most active period was .Womens suffrageeditFurther information Womens suffrage in the United States Charlotte Perkins Gilman pictured wrote these articles about feminism for the Atlanta Constitution, published on December , . Excerpt of a reading of Susan B Anthonys  speech at her trial advocating for womans suffrage, arguing that it was guaranteed by the th amendment.  Anthony was found guilty of voting illegally in New York, her trial had no jury and the fine issued against her was never enforced to prevent her case from being taken to the Supreme court. Anthony remained prominent in American Firstwave feminism until her death in .The womens suffrage movement began with the June  National Convention of the Liberty Party. Presidential candidate Gerrit Smith argued for and established womens suffrage as a party plank. One month later, his cousin Elizabeth Cady Stanton joined with Lucretia Mott and other women to organize the Seneca Falls Convention, featuring the Declaration of Sentiments demanding equal rights for women, and the right to vote.dMany of these activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The womens rights campaign during firstwave feminism was led by Stanton, Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony, among many others. Stone and Paulina Wright Davis organized the prominent and influential National Womens Rights Convention in .The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Womens Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights, though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.Around  the feminist movement began to reawaken, putting an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women. Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capital and major cities. Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association NAWSA, which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by Carrie Chapman Catt, and formed the more militant National Womans Party. Suffragists were arrested during their Silent Sentinels pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as political prisoners.The old antisuffragist argument that only men could fight in a war, and therefore only men deserve the right to vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, industrialized countries with similar experiences gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the states in the western U.S. had already given the women the right to vote in state and federal elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in , and women could vote in .NAWSA became the League of Women Voters, and the National Womans Party began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pass Congress during the second wave of the womens movement in . Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, and world peace. The main surge of women voting came in , when the bigcity machines realized they needed the support of women to elect Al Smith, a Catholic from New York City. Meanwhile, Protestants mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert Hoover.Women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote in Womens suffragists parade in New York City in , carrying placards with signatures of more than a million women.Women surrounded by posters in English and Yiddish supporting Franklin D.

Germany decided to take the risk and try to win by cutting off supplies to Britain through the sinking of ships such as the RMS Lusitania. The U.S. declared war in April  mainly from the threat of the Zimmermann Telegram.American money, food, and munitions arrived in Europe quickly, but troops had to be drafted and trained. By the summer of  American Expeditionary Forces soldiers under General John J. Pershings American Expeditionary Forces arrived at the rate of , a day, while Germany was unable to replace its losses. Dissent against the war was suppressed by the Sedition Act of   Espionage Act of . German language, leftist  pacifist publications were suppressed, and over , were imprisoned for speaking out against the war. The political prisoners were later released by U.S. President Warren G. Harding.The result was Allied victory in November . President Wilson demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms in the famed Fourteen Points speech. Wilson dominated the  Paris Peace Conference but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the Treaty of Versailles  as Wilson put all his hopes in the new League of Nations. Wilson refused to compromise with Senate Republicans over the issue of Congressional power to declare war, and the Senate rejected the Treaty and the League.Roaring twentieseditMain article History of the United States Further information Roaring Twenties and Causes of the Great Depression Prohibition agents destroying barrels of alcohol in Chicago, In the s the U.S. grew steadily in stature as an economic and military world power. The United States Senate did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles imposed by its Allies on the defeated Central Powers instead, the United States chose to pursue unilateralism. The aftershock of Russias October Revolution resulted in real fears of Communism in the United States, leading to a Red Scare and the deportation of aliens considered subversive. Money supply decreased a lot between Black Tuesday and the Bank Holiday in March  when there were massive bank runs across the United States.While public health facilities grew rapidly in the Progressive Era, and hospitals and medical schools were modernized, the country in  and  lost approximately , lives to the Spanish flu pandemic. I Got The Ritz From The One I Love, In , the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol were prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment, Prohibition. The result was that in cities illegal alcohol became a big business, largely controlled by racketeers.The second Ku Klux Klan grew rapidly in , then collapsed. Immigration laws were passed to strictly limit the number of new entries. The s were called the Roaring Twenties due to the great economic prosperity during this period. Jazz became popular among the younger generation, and thus the decade was also called the Jazz Age.The Great Depression  and the New Deal  were decisive moments in American political, economic, and social history that reshaped the nation.Great Depression and the New DealeditMain articles Great Depression in the United States and New DealSee also Good Neighbor policy Dorothea Langes Migrant Mother depicts destitute pea pickers in California, centering on Florence Owens Thompson, a mother of seven, age , in Nipomo, California, March .During the s, the nation enjoyed widespread prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A financial bubble was fueled by an inflated stock market, which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October , .full citation needed This, along with many other economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment soared from  in  to  in , farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by onethird. President Franklin Roosevelt engaged in radio Fireside chats as means with regularly communicating with the public, this was innovative for the time. During the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Brazil, . Brazilian President Getlio Vargas left and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt right in In , Democratic presidential nominee Franklin D. Roosevelt promised a New Deal for the American people, coining the enduring label for his domestic policies. The result was a series of permanent reform programs including Relief for the unemployed, assistance for the elderly, jobs for young men, social security, unemployment insurance, public housing, bankruptcy insurance, farm subsidies, and regulation of financial securities.State governments added new programs as well and introduced the sales tax to pay for them. Ideologically the revolution established modern liberalism in the United States and kept the Democrats in power in Washington almost continuously for three decades thanks to the New Deal coalition of ethnic whites, blacks, bluecollar workers, labor unions, and white Southerners. It provided relief to the longterm unemployed through numerous programs, such as the Works Progress Administration WPA and for young men, the Civilian Conservation Corps. Large scale spending projects designed to provide private sector construction jobs and rebuild the infrastructure were under the purview of the Public Works Administration.The Second New Deal was a turn to the left in , building up labor unions through the Wagner Act. Unions became a powerful element of the merging New Deal coalition, which won reelection for Roosevelt in , , and  by mobilizing union members, bluecollar workers, relief recipients, big city machines, ethnic, and religious groups especially Catholics and Jews and the white South, along with blacks in the North where they could vote. Roosevelt seriously weakened his second term by a failed effort to pack the Supreme Court, which had been a center of conservative resistance to his programs.Most of the relief programs were dropped after  in the s when the conservatives regained power in Congress through the Conservative coalition. Of special importance is the Social Security program, begun in . The economy basically recovered by , but had a sharp, short recession in  longterm unemployment, however, remained a problem until it was solved by wartime spending.In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, Roosevelt announced on March , , during his inaugural address, In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors.To create a friendly relationship between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, Roosevelt sought to stray from asserting military force in the region. This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelts Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December .As a result of the Great Depression, , to , Mexicans and Mexican Americans were voluntarily repatriated or formally deported to Mexico during the s, in what is known as the Mexican Repatriation.World War IIeditFurther information Military history of the United States during World War II, United States home front during World War II, and American women in World War II The Japanese crippled American naval power with the attack on Pearl Harbor, destroying many battleships. Into the Jaws of Death The Normandy landings began the Allied march toward Germany from the west. American corpses sprawled on the beach of Tarawa, November .In the Depression years, the United States remained focused on domestic concerns while democracy declined across the world and many countries fell under the control of dictators. Imperial Japan asserted dominance in East Asia and in the Pacific. Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy militarized and threatened conquests, while Britain and France attempted appeasement to avert another war in Europe. U.S. legislation in the Neutrality Acts sought to avoid foreign conflicts however, policy clashed with increasing antiNazi feelings following the German invasion of Poland in September  that started World War II.At first, Roosevelt positioned the U.S. as the Arsenal of Democracy, pledging fullscale financial and munitions support for the Allies and LendLease agreements  but no military personnel. Japan tried to neutralize Americas power in the Pacific by attacking Pearl Harbor in , but instead it catalyzed American support to enter the war. President Roosevelts Infamy Speech in aftermath of Pearl Harbor Attack. Congress consequently declared war on the Empire of Japan.The main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and especially , military personnel. Much of the focus the U.S. government was in maximizing the national economic output, causing a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as  of the GDP went to the war effort.Tens of millions of workers moved from lowproductivity occupations to highefficiency jobs, improving productivity through better technology and management. Students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed moved into the active labor force. Economic mobilization was managed by the War Production Board and a wartime production boom led to full employment, wiping out this vestige of the Great Depression. Labor shortages encouraged industry to look for new sources of workers, finding new roles for women and Blacks.Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline were tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression. Americans on the home front tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, increased pay, and the confidence that it was only for the duration, and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won.The Allies  the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union and other countries  saw Germany as the main threat and gave the highest priority to Europe. The U.S. dominated the war against Japan and stopped Japanese expansion in the Pacific in . After the attack at Pearl Harbor and the loss of the Philippines to Japanese conquests, as well as a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea May , the American Navy then inflicted a decisive blow at Midway June . American ground forces assisted in the North African campaign that eventually concluded with the collapse of Mussolinis fascist government in , as Italy switched to the Allied side. A more significant European front was opened on DDay, June , , in which American and Allied forces invaded Nazioccupied France from Britain.War fervor also inspired antiJapanese sentiment, leading to internment of Japanese Americans. Roosevelts Executive Order  resulted in over , Americans of Japanese descent being removed from their homes and placed in internment camps. Twothirds of those interned were American citizens and half of them were children. The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon.Military research and development also increase, leading to the Manhattan Project, a secret effort to harness nuclear fission to produce atomic bombs. The first nuclear device ever detonated was conducted July , .The Allies pushed the Germans out of France but the western front stopped short, leaving Berlin to the Soviets as the Nazi regime formally capitulated in May , ending the war in Europe. In the Pacific, the U.S. implemented an island hopping strategy toward Tokyo. The Philippines was eventually reconquered, after Japan and the United States fought in historys largest naval battle, The Battle of Leyte Gulf. However, the war wiped out all the development the United States invested in the Philippines as cities and towns were completely destroyed. After the devestation of the war, the United States granted its colony, the Philippines, independence.The United States then established airfields for bombing runs against mainland Japan from the Mariana Islands, achieving hardfought victories at Iwo Jima and Okinawa in . Bloodied at Okinawa, the U.S. prepared to invade Japans home islands when Bs dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, compelling Japan to surrender and ending World War II. The U.S. occupied Japan and part of Germany, and restructured Japan along American lines.During the war, Roosevelt coined the term Four Powers to refer four major Allies of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China, which later became the foundation of the United Nations Security Council. Though more than , military personnel and civilians were lost, the U.S. mostly prospered untouched by the physical devastation of war that inflicted a heavy toll on Europe and East Asia.Participation in postwar foreign affairs marked the end of predominant American isolationism. The threat of nuclear weapons inspired both optimism and fear. Nuclear weapons have not been used since the war ended, and a long peace began between the global powers in era of competition that came to be known as the Cold War. The Truman Doctrine characterized this reality on May , . Despite the absence of a global war during this period, there were, however, regional wars in Korea and Vietnam.Cold War, counterculture, and civil rightseditMain articles Cold War, History of the United States , History of the United States , and History of the United States Cold WareditMain articles Cold War , Cold War , and United States in the s As TV became commonplace after , presidential campaigns began to promote their causes with widespread coverage across the country. Here a commercial promoting John F. Kennedy from the  Election serves as an example.Following World War II, the United States emerged as one of the two dominant superpowers, the Soviet Union being the other. The U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote approved U.S. participation in the United Nations UN, which marked a turn away from the traditional isolationism of the U.S. and toward increased international involvement. Cuban Missile Crisis, a reconnaisse photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenanceThe primary American goal of  was to rescue Europe from the devastation of World War II and to contain the expansion of Communism, represented by the Soviet Union. U.S. foreign policy during the Cold War was built around the support of Western Europe and Japan along with the policy of containment, stopping the spread of communism. The U.S. joined the wars in Korea and Vietnam and toppled leftwing governments in the third world to try to stop its spread.The Truman Doctrine of  provided military and economic aid to Greece and Turkey to counteract the threat of Communist expansion in the Balkans. In , the United States replaced piecemeal financial aid programs with a comprehensive Marshall Plan, which pumped money into the economy of Western Europe, and removed trade barriers, while modernizing the managerial practices of businesses and governments.The Plans billion budget was in the context of a U.S. GDP of billion in  and was in addition to the billion in American aid given to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Marshall Plan. Soviet head of state Joseph Stalin prevented his satellite states from participating, and from that point on, Eastern Europe, with inefficient centralized economies, fell further and further behind Western Europe in terms of economic development and prosperity. In , the United States, rejecting the longstanding policy of no military alliances in peacetime, formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO alliance, which continues into the st century. In response the Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of communist states, leading to the Iron Curtain.In August  the Soviets tested their first nuclear weapon, thereby escalating the risk of warfare. The threat of mutually assured destruction however, prevented both powers from nuclear war, and resulted in proxy wars, especially in Korea and Vietnam, in which the two sides did not directly confront each other.President Dwight D. Eisenhower, elected in a landslide as the first Republican president since , had a lasting impact on American life and politics. He ended the Korean War, and avoided any other major conflict. He cut military spending by reliance on very high technology, such as nuclear weapons carried by longrange bombers and intercontinental missiles. He gave strong support to the NATO alliance and built other alliances along similar lines, but they never were especially effective.After Stalin died in , Eisenhower worked to obtain friendlier relationships with the Soviet Union. At home, he ended McCarthyism, expanded the Social Security program and presided over a decade of bipartisan comity. He promoted civil rights cautiously, and sent in the Army when trouble threatened over racial integration in Little Rock, Arkansas.The unexpected leapfrogging of American technology by the Soviets in  with Sputnik, the first Earth satellite, began the Space Race, won in  by the Americans as Apollo  landed astronauts on the Moon. The angst about the weaknesses of American education led to largescale federal support for science education and research. In the decades after World War II, the United States became a global influence in economic, political, military, cultural, and technological affairs.In , John F. Kennedy was elected President and his administration saw the acceleration of the countrys role in the Space Race, escalation of the American role in the Vietnam War, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the jailing of Martin Luther King Jr. during the Birmingham campaign.

Johnson secured congressional passage of his Great Society programs in the mids. They included civil rights, the end of legal segregation, Medicare, extension of welfare, federal aid to education at all levels, subsidies for the arts and humanities, environmental activism, and a series of programs designed to wipe out poverty. As later historians explainedGradually, liberal intellectuals crafted a new vision for achieving economic and social justice. The liberalism of the early s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly antiCommunist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agendamuch influenced by Keynesian economic theoryenvisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.Johnson was rewarded with an electoral landslide in  against conservative Barry Goldwater, which broke the decadeslong control of Congress by the Conservative coalition. However, the Republicans bounced back in  and elected Richard Nixon in . Nixon largely continued the New Deal and Great Society programs he inherited conservative reaction would come with the election of Ronald Reagan in . Meanwhile, the American people completed a great migration from farms into the cities and experienced a period of sustained economic expansion.Civil rights movementeditMain article Civil rights movement Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. right with President Lyndon B. Johnson in the background leftStarting in the late s, institutionalized racism across the United States, but especially in the South, was increasingly challenged by the growing Civil Rights Movement. The activism of AfricanAmerican leaders Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which launched the movement. For years African Americans would struggle with violence against them but would achieve great steps toward equality with Supreme Court decisions, including Brown v. Board of Education and Loving v. Virginia, the Civil Rights Act of , the Voting Rights Act of , and the Fair Housing Act of , which ended the Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation between whites and blacks.

Following his death others led the movement, most notably Kings widow, Coretta Scott King, who was also active, like her husband, in the Opposition to the Vietnam War, and in the Womens Liberation Movement. There were  riots in  American cities in the first nine months of . Frustrations with the seemingly slow progress of the integration movement led to the emergence of more radical discourses during the early s, which, in turn, gave rise to the Black Power movement of the late s and early s.The decade would ultimately bring about positive strides toward integration, especially in government service, sports, and entertainment. Native Americans turned to the federal courts to fight for their land rights. They held protests highlighting the federal governments failure to honor treaties. One of the most outspoken Native American groups was the American Indian Movement AIM. In the s, Cesar Chavez began organizing poorly paid MexicanAmerican farm workers in California. He led a fiveyearlong strike by grape pickers. Then Chvez formed the countrys first successful union of farm workers. His United Farm Workers of America UFW faltered after a few years but after Chavez died in  he became an iconic folk saint in the pantheon of Mexican Americans.Womens liberationeditFurther information Secondwave feminism AntiVietnam War demonstration, A new consciousness of the inequality of American women began sweeping the nation, starting with the  publication of Betty Friedans bestseller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation of the notion that women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In  Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women NOW to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans. Two hippies at WoodstockProtests began, and the new womens liberation movement grew in size and power, gained much media attention, and, by , had replaced the Civil Rights Movement as the U.Ss main social revolution. Marches, parades, rallies, boycotts, and pickets brought out thousands, sometimes millions. There were striking gains for women in medicine, law, and business, while only a few were elected to office.The womens movement was split into factions by political ideology early on, with NOW on the left, the Womens Equity Action League WEAL on the right, the National Womens Political Caucus NWPC in the center, and more radical groups formed by younger women on the farleft. The proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution, passed by Congress in  was defeated by a conservative coalition mobilized by Phyllis Schlafly. They argued that it degraded the position of the housewife and made young women susceptible to the military draft.However, many federal laws i.e. those equalizing pay, employment, education, employment opportunities, and credit ending pregnancy discrimination and requiring NASA, the Military Academies, and other organizations to admit women, state laws i.e., those ending spousal abuse and marital rape, Supreme Court rulings i.e. ruling that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to women, and state ERAs established womens equal status under the law, and social custom and consciousness began to change, accepting womens equality. The controversial issue of abortion, deemed by the Supreme Court as a fundamental right in Roe v. Wade , is still a point of debate today.Counterculture and Cold War dtenteeditMain articles Cold War  and Counterculture of the s United States Navy F Phantom II shadows a Soviet Tu Bear D aircraft in the early s.Amid the Cold War, the United States entered the Vietnam War, whose growing unpopularity fed already existing social movements, including those among women, minorities, and young people. President Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society social programs and numerous rulings by the Warren Court added to the wide range of social reform during the s and s. Feminism and the environmental movement became political forces, and progress continued toward civil rights for all Americans. The Counterculture Revolution swept through the nation and much of the western world in the late sixties and early seventies, further dividing Americans in a culture war but also bringing forth more liberated social views.Johnson was succeeded in  by Republican Richard Nixon, who attempted to gradually turn the war over to the South Vietnamese forces. He negotiated the peace treaty in  which secured the release of POWs and led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The war had cost the lives of , American troops. Nixon manipulated the fierce distrust between the Soviet Union and China to the advantage of the United States, achieving dtente with both parties. Richard Nixon departsThe Watergate scandal, involving Nixons coverup of his operatives breakin into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex destroyed his political base, sent many aides to prison, and forced Nixons resignation on August , . He was succeeded by Vice President Gerald Ford. The Fall of Saigon, on April , , ended the Vietnam War and resulted in North and South Vietnam being reunited. Communist victories in neighboring Cambodia and Laos occurred in the same year, with the fall of Cambodias capital, Phnom Penh on April  and the taking of Laoss capital, Vientiane on December . The OPEC oil embargo marked a longterm economic transition since, for the first time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late s, the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with highinterest rates the term stagflation was coined. Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.Jimmy Carter, running as someone who was not a part of the Washington political establishment, was elected president in . On the world stage, Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. In , Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took  Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the  election to the Republican Ronald Reagan. On January , , minutes after Carters term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the day hostage crisis.Rise of conservatism and the end of the Cold WareditMain articles Reagan Era, Republican Revolution, Cold War , and Cold War  Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate challenges Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall in , shortly before the end of the Cold War. President Reagans Brandenburg Gate speech, famous for the phrase Tear down this wallRonald Reagan produced a major political realignment with his  and  landslide elections. Reagans economic policies dubbed Reaganomics and the implementation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of  lowered the top marginal tax rate from  to  over the course of seven years. Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation. The U.S. experienced a recession in , but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from  to , the unemployment rate decreasing from . in December  to . in November , and the economic growth rate increasing from . to ..Reagan ordered a buildup of the U.S. military, incurring additional budget deficits. Reagan introduced a complicated missile defense system known as the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI dubbed Star Wars by opponents in which, theoretically, the U.S. could shoot down missiles with laser systems in space. The Soviets reacted harshly because they thought it violated the  AntiBallistic Missile Treaty and would upset the balance of power by giving the U.S. a major military advantage. For years Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev argued vehemently against SDI. However, by the late s he decided the system would never work and should not be used to block disarmament deals with the U.S.Historians argue how great an impact the SDI threat had on the Soviets  whether it was enough to force Gorbachev to initiate radical reforms, or whether the deterioration of the Soviet economy alone forced the reforms. There is agreement that the Soviets realized they were well behind the Americans in military technology, that to try to catch up would be very expensive, and that the military expenses were already a very heavy burden slowing down their economy.The  Invasion of Grenada and  bombing of Libya were popular in the U.S., though his backing of the Contras rebels was mired in the controversy over the IranContra affair.Reagan met four times with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who ascended to power as General Secretary of the Communist Party in , and their summit conferences led to the signing of the IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces Treaty. Gorbachev tried to save Communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive nuclear arms race with America, then by shedding the East European empire in . The Soviet Union collapsed on Christmas Day , ending the U.SSoviet Cold War. IntermediateRange Nuclear Forces TreatyFor the remainder of the th century, the United States emerged as the worlds sole remaining superpower and continued to intervene in international affairs during the s, including the  Gulf War against Iraq. Following his election in , President Bill Clinton oversaw one of the longest periods of economic expansion and unprecedented gains in securities values. President Clinton worked with the Republican Congress to pass the first balanced federal budget in  years.Much of the economic boom was a side effect of the Digital Revolution and new business opportunities created by the internet privatized in . Prior to this time ARPNET a Department of Defense Project had developed the internet for governmental, and research purposes.In , Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of lying under oath about perjury regarding a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. He was acquitted by the Senate. The failure of impeachment and the Democratic gains in the  election forced House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican, to resign from Congress. Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat during the Oslo Accords on September , The Republican Party expanded its base throughout the South after  except , largely due to its strength among socially conservative white Evangelical Protestants and traditionalist Roman Catholics, added to its traditional strength in the business community and suburbs. As white Democrats in the South lost dominance of the Democratic Party in the s, the region took on the twoparty apparatus which characterized most states. The Republican Partys central leader by  was Ronald Reagan, whose conservative policies called for reduced government spending and regulation, lower taxes, and a strong antiSoviet foreign policy.His iconic status in the party persists into the st century, as practically all Republican Party leaders acknowledge his stature. Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue, The Republican party, nationally, moved from rightcenter toward the center in the s and s, then moved right again in the s and s. They add The Democratic party, nationally, moved from leftcenter toward the center in the s and s, then moved further toward the rightcenter in the s and s.The close presidential election in  between Governor George W. Bush and Al Gore helped lay the seeds for political polarization to come. The vote in the decisive states of New Mexico and Florida was extremely close and produced a dramatic dispute over the counting of votes. Including , the Democrats outpolled the Republicans in the national vote in every election from  to , except for .st centuryedit and the war on terroreditMain article History of the United States Further information September  attacks, War on terror, and Presidency of George W. Bush The Nasdaq Composite index swelled with the dotcom bubble in the optimistic New economy. The bubble burst in .On September ,  , the United States was struck by a terrorist attack when  alQaeda hijackers commandeered four airliners to be used in suicide attacks and intentionally crashed two into both twin towers of the World Trade Center and the third into the Pentagon, killing , victims aboard the three airliners, , who were in the World Trade Center and on the ground, and  who were in the Pentagon. The fourth plane was retaken by the passengers and crew of the aircraft. While they were not able to land the plane safely, they were able to retake control of the aircraft and crash it into an empty field in Pennsylvania, killing all  people including the four terrorists on board, thereby saving whatever target the terrorists were aiming for. Within two hours, both Twin Towers of the World Trade Center completely collapsed causing massive damage to the surrounding area and blanketing Lower Manhattan in toxic dust clouds. All in all, a total of , victims perished in the attacks. In response, President George W. Bush on September  announced a war on terror. On October , , the United States and NATO then invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime, which had provided safe haven to alQaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden. The former World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during September  attacks in  President Bushs address in reaction to the  attacksThe federal government established new domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. The USA PATRIOT Act increased the governments power to monitor communications and removed legal restrictions on information sharing between federal law enforcement and intelligence services. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was created to lead and coordinate federal counterterrorism activities. Since , the U.S. governments indefinite detention of terrorism suspects captured abroad at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, a prison at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, led to allegations of human rights abuses and violations of international law. George W. Bush addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on September , , to outline the complaints of the United States government against the Iraqi government.In , from March  to May , the United States launched an invasion of Iraq, which led to the collapse of the Iraq government and the eventual capture of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, with whom the U.S. had longstanding tense relations. The reasons for the invasion cited by the Bush administration included the spreading of democracy, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction a key demand of the UN as well, though later investigations found parts of the intelligence reports to be inaccurate, and the liberation of the Iraqi people. Despite some initial successes early in the invasion, the continued Iraq War fueled international protests and gradually saw domestic support decline as many people began to question whether or not the invasion was worth the cost. In , after years of violence by the Iraqi insurgency, President Bush deployed more troops in a strategy dubbed the surge. While the death toll decreased, the political stability of Iraq remained in doubt. U.S. military presence in the world in In , the unpopularity of President Bush and the Iraq war, along with the  financial crisis, led to the election of Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, with AfricanAmerican ancestry. After his election, Obama reluctantly continued the war effort in Iraq until August , , when he declared that combat operations had ended. However, , American soldiers and military personnel were kept in Iraq to assist Iraqi forces, help protect withdrawing forces, and work on counterterrorism until December , , when the war was declared formally over and the last troops left the country. At the same time, Obama increased American involvement in Afghanistan, starting a surge strategy using an additional , troops, while proposing to begin withdrawing troops sometime in December . In , on his second day in office, Obama issued an executive order banning the use of torture, a prohibition codified into law in . Obama also ordered the closure of secret CIArun prisons overseas black sites. Obama sought to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as soon as practicable and over his tenure the population of the detention camp declined from  inmates to  inmates the Guantanamo Review Task Force cleared many prisoners for release and resettlement abroad. Obamas efforts to close the prison entirely were stymied by Congress, which in  enacted a measure blocking Obama from transferring any Guantanamo detainees to U.S. facilities.In May , after nearly a decade in hiding, the founder and leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was killed in Pakistan in a raid conducted by U.S. naval special forces acting under President Obamas direct orders. While Al Qaeda was near collapse in Afghanistan, affiliated organizations continued to operate in Yemen and other remote areas as the CIA used drones to hunt down and remove its leadership.The Boston Marathon bombing was a bombing incident, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon on April , . The bombs exploded near the marathons finish line, killing  people and injuring an estimated  others.The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant rose to prominence in September . In addition to taking control of much of Western Iraq and Eastern Syria, ISIS also beheaded three journalists, two American and one British. These events lead to a major military offensive by the United States and its allies in the region.On December , , Obama officially ended the combat mission in Afghanistan and promised a withdrawal of all remaining U.S. troops at the end of  with the exception of the embassy guards. The US military mission formally ended on August , .Great RecessioneditMain article Great Recession in the United States Barack Obama inauguration speech  Tea Party protesters walk towards the United States Capitol during the Taxpayer March on Washington, September , .In September , the United States and most of Europe entered the longest postWorld War II recession, often called the Great Recession. Multiple overlapping crises were involved, especially the housing market crisis, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, an automotive industry crisis, rising unemployment, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The financial crisis threatened the stability of the entire economy in September  when Lehman Brothers failed and other giant banks were in grave danger. Starting in October the federal government lent billion to financial institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program which was passed by bipartisan majorities and signed by Bush. Barack Obama was the first AfricanAmerican president of the United States.Following his election victory by a wide electoral margin in November , Bushs successor  Barack Obama  signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of , which was a billion economic stimulus aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession. Obama, like Bush, took steps to rescue the auto industry and prevent future economic meltdowns. These included a bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, putting ownership temporarily in the hands of the government, and the cash for clunkers program which temporarily boosted new car sales.The recession officially ended in June , and the economy slowly began to expand once again. Beginning in December , the unemployment rate steeply rose from around  to a peak of  before falling as the economy and labor markets experienced a recovery. The economic expansion that followed the Great Recession was the longest in U.S. history strong growth led to the unemployment rate reaching a year low in . Despite the strong economy, increases in the costs of housing, child care, higher education, and outofpocket healthcare expenses surpassed increases in wages, a phenomenon some referred to as an affordability crisis. The economic expansion came to an end in early  with a sharp economic contraction largely caused by the COVID pandemic, which seriously affected the United States.Recent events in seditMain article History of the United States presentSee also Presidency of Barack Obama, Presidency of Donald Trump, ChinaUnited States trade war, COVID pandemic in the United States, and Presidency of Joe Biden The White House lit with rainbow colors in celebration of the legalization of gay marriageFrom  to , the th Congress passed major legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, informally known as Obamacare, the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Dont Ask, Dont Tell Repeal Act, which were signed into law by President Obama. Following the  midterm elections, which resulted in a Republicancontrolled House of Representatives and a Democraticcontrolled Senate, Congress presided over a period of elevated gridlock and heated debates over whether or not to raise the debt ceiling, extend tax cuts for citizens making over , annually, and many other key issues. These ongoing debates led to President Obama signing the Budget Control Act of . Following Obamas  reelection, Congressional gridlock continued as Congressional Republicans call for the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act along with other various demands, resulted in the first government shutdown since the Clinton administration and almost led to the first default on U.S. debt since the th century. As a result of growing public frustration with both parties in Congress since the beginning of the decade, Congressional approval ratings fell to record lows.Recent events also include the rise of new political movements, such as the conservative Tea Party movement and the liberal Occupy movement. The debate over the issue of rights for the LGBT community, including samesex marriage, began to shift in favor of samesex couples. In , President Obama became the first president to openly support samesex marriage, and the Supreme Court provided for federal recognition of samesex unions and then nationwide legalized gay marriage in .Political debate has continued over tax reform, immigration reform, income inequality, and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, particularly with regards to global terrorism, the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and an accompanying climate of Islamophobia.The late s were marked by widespread social upheaval and change in the United States. The MeToo movement gained popularity, exposing alleged sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace. Multiple prominent celebrities were accused of misconduct or rape. During this period, the Black Lives Matter movement also gained support online, exacerbated by the police killings of multiple black Americans. Multiple mass shootings, including the Pulse Nightclub shooting  and the Las Vegas shooting, which claimed the lives of  people, led to increased calls for gun control and reform. Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in , gun control advocates organized the March for Our Lives, where millions of students across the country walked out of school to protest gun violence. The Womens March protest against Trumps presidency in  was one of the largest protests in American history. A man stands on a burned out car following protests over the murder of George Floyd.In , following a contentious election, Republican Donald Trump was elected president. The results of the election were called into question, and U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that associates of the Russian government interfered in the election to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. This, along with questions about potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, led to investigations by the FBI and Congress.During Trumps presidency, he espoused an America First ideology, placing restrictions on asylum seekers and imposing a widely controversial ban on immigration from seven Muslimmajority countries. Many of his executive orders and other actions were challenged in court. During his presidency he also engaged the United States in a trade war with China, imposing a wide range of tariffs on Chinese products. In , controversy erupted over the Trump administrations zero tolerance policy towards illegal immigrants, which involved the separation of thousands of undocumented children from their parents. After public outcry, Trump rescinded this policy. Trumps term also saw the confirmation of three new justices to the Supreme Court, cementing a conservative majority.In , a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump had withheld foreign aid from Ukraine under the demand that they investigate the business dealings of the son of Trumps political opponent. As a result, Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of congress, becoming the third president to have been impeached, but he was acquitted.COVID pandemic and other events in sedit A naval officer checks on a patient connected to a ventilator in Baton Rouge during the COVID pandemic.The worldwide COVID pandemic having arrived in the United States was first confirmed in January . By February , the Trump administration restricted travel to and from China. On March , the WHO declared the virus to be a pandemic. In March, many state and local governments imposed stay at home orders to slow the spread of the virus, with the goal of reducing patient overload in hospitals. By March , New York Times data showed the United States to have the highest number of known cases of any country. By March , the country had reported over , cases. On April , at President Trumps direction, the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS and CDC ordered additional preventive guidelines to the longterm care facility industry. On April , the U.S. death toll became the highest in the world when the number of deaths reached ,, surpassing that of Italy. On April , the CMS added new regulations requiring nursing homes to inform residents, their families and representatives, of COVID cases in their facilities. On April , the total number of confirmed cases across the country surpassed million. As of May update, the U.S. has suffered more official COVID deaths than any other country with the death toll standing at  million, with the U.S. death toll surpassing the number of U.S. deaths during the Spanish flu pandemic, although the Spanish flu killed  in  Americans compared to COVID killing  in  Americans. As a result of the COVID pandemic, U.S. life expectancy fell by over a year in  and unemployment rates rose to the worst rates since the Great Depression. In , U.S. life expectancy decreased by around half a year. The May  murder of George Floyd caused mass protests and riots in many major cities over police brutality, with many states calling in the National Guard. was marked by a rise in domestic terrorist threats and widespread conspiracy theories around mailin voting and COVID. The QAnon conspiracy theory, a fringe farright political movement among some ardent conservatives, gained publicity and multiple major cities were hit by rioting and brawls between farleft antifascist affiliated groups and far right groups such as the Proud Boys. Supporters of thenPresident Donald Trump attempted to stop the counting of electoral votes on January , .Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the  presidential election, the first defeat of an incumbent president since . The election, with an exceptional amount of voting by mail and early voting due to the danger of contracting COVID at traditional voting booths, had historically high voter turnout. Trump then repeatedly made false claims of massive voter fraud and election rigging, leading to the January  United States Capitol attack by supporters of Trump and rightwing militias. That storming led to Trumps impeachment, as the only U.S. president to be impeached twice. The Senate later acquitted Trump despite some members of his own Republican party voting against him. After the  inauguration, Bidens runningmate, thenSenator Kamala Harris, became both the first AfricanAmerican and first woman vice president of the United States.The biggest mass vaccination campaign in U.S. history kicked off on December , , when ICU nurse Sandra Lindsay became the first person in the U.S. to receive the PfizerBioNTech COVID vaccine. As of August ,  of the U.S. population has received a dose of the Pfizer BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson  Johnson COVID vaccine.Following Bidens election, the date for US troops to withdraw from Afghanistan was moved back from April to August , . In Afghanistan, the withdrawal coincided with the  Taliban offensive, culminating in the fall of Kabul. Following a massive airlift of over , people, the US military mission formally ended on August , .Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of  a . trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent , stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act a tenyear plan brokered by Biden alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Courtthe first Black womanto serve the court. Biden proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. However, in August , Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of , a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a threeyear extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. From June of  Biden went on a string of legislative achievements with the signing of The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, a massive investment in the Semiconductor industry and manufacturing, Honoring our PACT Act of , expansion of veterans healthcare and the Respect for Marriage Act, repealing the Defense of Marriage Act and codifying Samesex and Interracial marriage.
